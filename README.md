At Particle Health, we analyze and supply all kinds of health data for all kinds of clients, both internal and external. This take home assignment is meant to gauge your comfort working with data and your programming ability.

We would prefer that you complete the assignment in Python. If you're not very comfortable with Python, you may use a different programming language, but please do not use any kind of spreadsheet software (Excel, Google Sheets, etc.)

You should only spend a few hours on this assignment (no more than ​5 hours​, please) and submit it within 4 days of receipt (i.e. if you receive it on a Monday, it's due by Friday night; if you receive it on a Wednesday, it's due by Sunday night). We realize that this is less than the time required to do impeccable work, and that's totally fine. Do your best to get a working version, and note what you would have done given more time in the README. 

## Ingredients
This folder contains:
- This readme
- A csv of (fake) patients and their demographic info
- A JSON document containing information about patient encounters 

## Part 1: Coding
Create and submit code to:
- Find the patient with the most encounters
- Calculate the number of vaccine appointments by gender
- Calculate the number of encounters per year
- Create a data visualization of your choice. Please use code to get data into the correct shape to visualize, but you can use any program to create the visualization. Write a quick paragraph about your visualization, aimed at a non-technical audience, explaining why it's useful and how to interpret it. 

Make sure your code uses functions and can run outside of a notebook!

Please also provide a README targeted at a technical audience, explaining how to set up and run your code and any future improvements you might make. We will actually be running your code, so make sure the instructions are accurate!


## Part 2: Questions
You can either answer these questions in the README or in a separate document. 

1. What are future improvements you might make for your code?
2. Let's say we want to run this code as a nightly job. What changes/additions would you make to it?
3. What are some issues you noticed with the data?
4. What data do you wish you had?

## Part 3: Submitting
Please submit your completed exercise to the link in the assignment email. Please do not post your solution publicly such as on Github.

Have fun!
If you have any questions, send an email to data.internships@particlehealth.com
